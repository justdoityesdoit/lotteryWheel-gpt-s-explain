const candidate = Array(45).fill().map((v, i) => i + 1);

//This line creates an array of length 45, fills it with undefined values, 
and then maps over each element to replace it with its index value plus one. 
This creates an array of numbers from 1 to 45, which are the candidates for the lottery.



const shuffle = [];
while (candidate.length > 0) {
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * candidate.length); //randomly choose the index
  const spliceArray = candidate.splice(random, 1); //chosen result are in the array
  const value = spliceArray[0]; //pick up the result in the array
  shuffle.push(value); //put them into the shuffle
}
console.log(shuffle);

//This code shuffles the array of candidate numbers using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. 
It starts by creating an empty array called shuffle. Then it enters a loop that repeats 
while there are still candidate numbers left. Inside the loop, it generates a random integer 
between 0 and the length of the candidate array minus one, and uses that integer as an index 
to splice out one element from the candidate array. 
It then adds that element to the end of the shuffle array. Once the loop is finished, 
shuffle will contain a random permutation of the numbers 1 to 45.



const winBalls = shuffle.slice(0, 6).sort((a, b) => a - b);
const bonus = shuffle[6];
console.log(winBalls, bonus);

//This code creates two arrays, winBalls and bonus, that will be used to display 
the lottery results. winBalls is a sorted copy of the first six elements of the shuffled array. 
bonus is the seventh element of the shuffled array. 
The code then logs these arrays to the console for debugging purposes.



const $result = document.querySelector('#result');
const $bonus = document.querySelector('#bonus');

//These lines create two variables, $result and $bonus, that are set to the HTML elements 
with IDs "result" and "bonus", respectively. These elements will be used to display the lottery results.



function colorize(number, $tag) {
  if (number < 10) {
    $tag.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
    $tag.style.color = 'white';

    $tag.style.backgroundColor = 'orange';

};

//This code defines a function called colorize that takes two arguments: number, 
which is the lottery number to be colored, and $tag, which is the HTML element 
that will display the number. The function sets the background color and text color of 
the $tag element based on the value of number. If number is less than 10, the background color 
is red and the text color is white. If it's between 10 and 19, the background color is orange. 
If it's between 20 and 29, the background color is yellow. 
If it's between 30 and 39, the background color is blue and the text color is white. Otherwise, the background color is green
